## PowerShell

After you have clicked on Generated PowerShell you will get an PowerShell script which includes all your settings. If you run this PowerShell, it will check first which settings a device is supporting and only this one will be changed if needed. If your settings are still existing on a machine the configuration will be skipped.  The PowerShell supports settings and Application learning for optimization as well.

## Logging function (by PowerShell script)

The new script will be logging all action in Microsoft Events for later checking by administrators. There are different Log IDs for Application learning, lock/unlock and change settings to make it easier to find failures at you deployment.
